# SWE-Agent-Bench

1. Setup the Docker container: `./setup.sh`
2. Run demo: `python run_demo.py swe --mode=human_ai --model=gpt-3.5-turbo --template=swe --use_toy_example`
3. TODO: run multi-turn with proper logging.

Please refer to the [change log](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/intercode/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for information on the latest updates to the InterCode environment.

## üëã Overview
InterCode is a lightweight, flexible, and easy-to-use **framework for designing interactive code environments** to **evaluate language agents that can code**.

For an overview of InterCode, building interactive code tasks with InterCode, and evaluating agents on InterCode environments, please check out our [website](https://intercode-benchmark.github.io/), [wiki](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/intercode/wiki), and the original paper:

## üöÄ Quick Start
You can install InterCode as a PyPI package or by building from source.

> **Note**
> InterCode requires the following installations to run:
> * `python` >= 3.8
> * `docker`: Learn more [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install. Before running the below code, make sure the Docker daemon/application is running locally.

### üêç PyPI Package
1. Install the ([pypi package](https://pypi.org/project/intercode-bench/)):
```bash
pip install intercode-bench
```
2. Copy + Paste the following code for interacting with the InterCode Bash environment into a python file (i.e. `run_bash.py`)
```python
import readline
from intercode.assets import bash_build_docker, bash_image_name, bash_test_data
from intercode.envs import BashEnv

if __name__ == '__main__':
    bash_build_docker()
    env = BashEnv(bash_image_name, data_path=bash_test_data, traj_dir="logs/", verbose=True)

    try:
        for idx in range(3):
            env.reset()
            obs, done = env.observation, False
            while not done:
                action = input('> ')
                obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Keyboard interrupt detected")
    finally:
        env.close()
```
3. Run the file (i.e. `python run_bash.py`)

If InterCode was installed successfully, the InterCode Bash environment should be started successfully and a CLI interpreter should appear, allowing you to enter `bash` commands to interact with the task setting.
You can `ctrl + c` at any to time to exit the environment.
Similar starter code for the InterCode SQL environment is available on the PyPI [page](https://pypi.org/project/intercode-bench/).

### üíΩ Build from Source
1. Clone this repository, create a virtual environment, and install necessary dependencies
```bash
git clone https://github.com/princeton-nlp/intercode.git
cd intercode
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate intercode
```
2. Run `setup.sh` to create the docker images for the InterCode Bash, CTF, Python, and SQL environments
3. Run `python run_demo.py sql`

If InterCode was installed successfully, the InterCode SQL environment should be started successfully and a CLI interpreter should appear, allowing you to enter `SQL` commands to interact with the task environment.
You can `ctrl + c` at any to time to exit the environment.
Check [`run_demo.py`](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/intercode/blob/master/run_demo.py#L21) for the latest full list of available environments.

### üß™ Run Experiments
If you'd like to run the scripts in the `experiments` folder, make sure you have at least one of the following keys declared
1. As an environment variable, or
2. Specified in a `keys.cfg` file formatted as follows + located in the root of this repository:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY: 'key here'
PALM_API_KEY: 'key here'
```
